Prototypes are used so that we can use a function or a struct in any order.
This is because, when the code is compiling, first of all it's compile the files.h and then the files.c.
With this, in any file.c that we can use a function declarated in a file.h no matter if this function is compiled or not.
Because the prototype of the function is compiled.
