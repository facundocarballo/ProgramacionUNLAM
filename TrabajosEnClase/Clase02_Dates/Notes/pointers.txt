To pass the address from a variable we used the operator (&)

When we received a pointer in a function, we use (const Date* nameOfThePointer)
Each pointer have his own struct, therefore ALWAYS we have to pass the type of the struct.
The asterisk (*) tells you that the variable that you have it's a pointer.

If we received a pointer to access each component of the struct instead of use (date.day)
we have to use (date->day).
This happends because a pointer to a memory address can't be used like a variable, so 
to get all the information we need an instance of this variable.
